## About  
Utility Belt is a mod for the Fabric/Quilt Loader
that allows you to clean up your hotbar by giving you an extra four hotbar slots.  

### F.A.Q  
**Q:** **Why did you fork this?**  
**A:** The original mod had a feature that moved items to/from the utility belt when you pressed shift,
this became extremely annoying very quickly as I was needing to swap whilst sneaking.  
I made this fork to remove that feature.  

I also wanted to make it, so I could use ANY item in the belt,
not just tools â€” this makes it "kinda" like a backpack but doesn't make shulker boxes completely useless.  

**Q:** **How do I craft/use the Utility Belt?**  
**A:** You can craft the Utility Belt with four string, three leather, and one diamond.  
You must place the Utility Belt into the 'belt' trinket slot to use it.
